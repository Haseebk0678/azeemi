      towards sainthood developed in him and he start spending most of his time in the shrine of Maulana Kabli situated
      in the cemetery. He used to go there early in the morning and would come back late in the evening.

      The second part of his training (lasting nine years) was spent under the vigilant guidance of his maternal
      grandfather Baba Tajuddin Nagpuri who was a saint. After the partition of the subcontinent he moved to Karachi. He
      chose journalism as a career and was appointed the sub-editor of the Daily Urdu Dawn.

      In 1956 when Qutab-e-Arshad hazrat Abu'al Qalandar Ali Suharwardi (Hazrat Jee) visited Karachi, Qalandar Baba
      Auliya requested him to accept him as one of his disciples. Hazrat Jee told him to come to his hotel room at 3:00
      am. It was freezing cold when he reached the hotel at 2:00am and occupied the doorsteps. Exactly at 3:00am Hazrat

      Suharwardi completed the course of teachings of Qutab-e-Arshad in three weeks and declared him as his Khalifa
      (delegate).

      (Ilm-e-Ludduni) directly from the Holy Prophet. He was accorded the opportunity of appearing before the Lord
      Creator, Allah the Almighty Himself, Who then taught him knowledge of His mysteries and secrets. He passed away on
      27 January 1979 in Karachi, Pakistan.

      A Qalander is a person whose perceptive faculties go beyond the physical realm. He ascends from the material realm
      to the heights where he witnesses the Divine Unity. This is the zone of Taqveen or the Divine Administration. The
      Qalander experiences the ecstasy and joy of the nearness of the Creator (Whole). Thus he perceives the whole
      Truth. Such persons are called the friends (Aulia) of God.
